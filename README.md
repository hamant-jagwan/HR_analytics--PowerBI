## Description
### Problem Statement:ðŸ“‰ðŸ¤”
At AtliQ Hardware, effectively managing employee attendance, remote work arrangements, and sick leave is critical for both operational efficiency and employee well-being. However, the current system lacks a sophisticated analysis, leaving the organization without valuable insights needed for informed decision-making.

### Challenges:
**Attendance Insight Gaps:**
The current system struggles to provide a complete picture of employee attendance. It lacks the ability to quantify how much time employees spend at the workplace compared to the total available working days, limiting the understanding of attendance patterns.

**Remote Work Visibility Issues:**
With the rise of remote work, understanding its impact on overall productivity is crucial. The organization faces challenges in evaluating remote work patterns and their relationship with in-office attendance, hindering the formulation of effective remote work policies.

**Inadequate Sick Leave Management:**
The existing tools for managing sick leave lack depth. There is a need for a more comprehensive analysis of sick leave trends and their correlation with overall attendance. Currently, there is no clear understanding of the percentage of time employees spend on sick leave relative to total available working days.

### The Need for a Data-Driven Solution:ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¡
To address these challenges, AtliQ Hardware aims to implement a data-driven solution using Power BI. This will enable the calculation and visualization of key metricsâ€”Presence Percentage, Work From Home Percentage (WFH %), and Sick Leave Percentage (SL %)â€”providing actionable insights for better workforce management and a healthier work environment.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
        1. Presence percentage  : the proportion of time an individual has been present relative to the total available working days.
        
        2. Work From Home percentage (WFH %) : the proportion of time spent working remotely in relation to the total days of physical presence.
        
        3. Sick Leave percentage(SL %) : the proportion of time taken as sick leave relative to the overall available working days

## Visualizations:
        1. KPIs (Gauge Chart)        :  A gauge chart in Power BI visually represents a single value within a predefined range, 
                                        providing a quick and intuitive way to assess performance or metrics against set targets
                                        
        2. Attendance record (Table) :  A table in Power BI is a data visualization that organizes and displays information in a tabular format, 
                                        presenting data in rows and columns for easy analysis and exploration.
                                        
        3. Months & Date (Slicer)    :  A slicer in Power BI is a user interface element that enables interactive filtering and selection of data within a report, 
                                        allowing users to dynamically control and customize the displayed information by choosing specific values or ranges
                                        
        4. Presence % , WFH % & SL % (Area Chart):      An area chart in Power BI is a data visualization that displays the magnitude of values over a continuous axis, 
                                                        with the area between the line connecting data points and the axis filled, 
                                                        providing a visual representation of cumulative or stacked values over time or categories
